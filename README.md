# KYC Validaor Project

## Table of Contents

## Use cases
-  We can retrived user's KYC data off chain and store it in the smart contract. We can periodically refresh this data. 
-  Other smart contract can call this contract to check the user's current KYC status. 

## Mechanics
-  Truffle - used to build and deploy the smart contract. 
-  web3-React - used to conect smart contract with React UI.  
-  Chainlink - used to call off chain API. 
-  Infuar - used to deploy ontract on chain
